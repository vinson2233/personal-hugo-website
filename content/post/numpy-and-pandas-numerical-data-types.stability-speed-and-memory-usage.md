What could go wrong if I use float32 instead of float64 ?  
I need more speed for my calculation without changing my code alot, is changing data types coud help me?  
I have limited RAM for processing huge dataset, what does this post means to me ?  
The goal of this post is to answer these question, focusing on speed and precision, without much tough about how it implemented. Iâ€™m assuming you to have some familiarity with Python, Numpy and Pandas.

List of thing we need to consider :

* Numerical Stability
* Speed
* Memory

### Numerical Stability

  
We need to make sure our number calculated correctly. Floating number (in almost every programming language that i know) have some unavoidable inaccuracies. This is the most famous example of such case.
